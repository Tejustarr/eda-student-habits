# Exploratory Data Analysis: Student Habits and Academic Performance

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted as part of the M.Tech in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence program. The project analyzes the relationship between various student habits and their academic performance to uncover actionable insights.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive EDA on a dataset of student habits and academic scores. The analysis follows a structured approach:

1.  **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:** Preparing the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting statistical analysis and creating visualizations to understand data distributions, identify relationships between variables, and detect patterns.
3.  **Insight Generation:** Drawing meaningful conclusions from the analysis that could guide academic improvement strategies.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the **"Student Habits vs. Academic Performance"** dataset.

* **Source:** The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayaantanaath/student-habits-vs-academic-performance).
* **Description:** This dataset contains 18 features that describe student demographics, lifestyle choices, and academic results. It originally consists of 1040 rows.
* **Key Features Analyzed:**
    * `gender`, `age`, `parental_education_level`
    * `study_hours_per_day`, `attendance_percentage`
    * `social_media_hours`, `netflix_hours`
    * `sleep_hours`, `exercise_frequency`, `diet_quality`
    * `extracurricular_participation`
    * `exam_score` (Target Variable)

## Instructions to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### 1. Project Setup

First, clone this repository or download the source files to your local machine. Your project directory should be structured as follows:

```
project-folder/
│
├── EDA_Project_Group1.ipynb
├── data_set.csv
├── README.md (this file)
└── PDS_Project_Team_01.pptx
```


### 2. Install Required Libraries

Navigate to your project directory using the terminal and install the necessary Python libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
Once the libraries are installed, launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

### 4. Run the Analysis
In the Jupyter Notebook interface that opens in your browser, navigate to and open the `EDA_Project_Group1.ipynb` file. You can then execute the code cells sequentially from top to bottom to reproduce the entire analysis, from data loading to final visualizations.
